These comments completely crowd out any other discussion just due to sheer volume.There's 90 comments on this thread at the moment. Maybe like 5 are discussing anything about the article itself. The rest are just totally predictable and generic comments, which is something the comment guidelines specifically ask to avoid. (And yes, I'm now also participating in that.)Now, fair enough. Maybe there really is nothing to be said about the concept of the product. There's definitely not much to be said yet about the execution given nobody here will have been able to use it, so that definitely limits the scope of meaningful discussion to be had. But since the spam won out, we'll never find out.If there's nothing of substance to talk about, we could just talk about nothing and let the obviously boring and uninteresting submission die in silence.And if you need to warn your family and friends not to use this product because you think it will be cancelled too soon, you'll probably reach them more effectively via methods other than HN.\", metadata={'source': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36697119', 'title': 'NotebookLM: An AI Notebook'}),\n",

So what? It\\'s still turned this thread into a wasteland and prevented any productive discussion.Posting in good faith isn\\'t a free pass to post off-topic, repetitive ir low-effort stuff. Just think about what the outcome of that kind of policy would be if applied across the board.For example, a lot of people have very strong opinions on divisive political issues. Should they be picking submissions that are tangentially related to those issues and hijacking the comments section for discussion about that subject? No, of course not. And I\\'m not saying that because I disagree with their hypothetical political opinions. I\\'m saying it because if that becomes the norm, we can\\'t have a discussion about the actual thing that 200 people thought was interesting enough to upvote, because all the discussion will be a retread of that political issue.It\\'s as if Rust evangelists posted comments about \"this bug would never happen in Rust\" in response to a technical deep dive to a security bug.

Or does it sound like a paralysed project with a few interns keeping things ticking over?And it was worse in the times before that changelog started. That’s hardly “going strong”, that’s surviving on life support.

This is relevant because depending on the intended experience the latency will matter.Overall it’s not a bad idea, but I do wonder what the monetization path will be for Google.
